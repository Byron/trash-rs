## 5.2.0 (2024-10-26)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-6d59fa939429d2eede8b7cf22b2e084bc3c546f4/> Short circuiting check for empty trash
   `is_empty()` is a short circuiting function that checks if the trash is
   empty on Freedesktop compatible systems and Windows.
   
   The main purpose of `is_empty()` is to avoid evaluating the entire trash
   context when the caller is only interested in whether the trash is empty
   or not. This is especially useful for full trashes with many items.

## 5.0.0 (2024-06-18)

<csr-id-58b99ef34a0dc6cce11fdc46c9fa18ffb013e33e/>

To support non-UTF8 encoding in paths, the `name` field changed from `String` 
to `OsString` in the `TrashItem` struct. As it's a return value, one won't see
code break unless `name` is actually used.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-15a15f8ad10791318c6d9de95d4fbaefa345fb56/> Support non-Unicode paths
   There are several spots where paths are assumed to be Unicode. However,
   some (all?) operating systems support non-Unicode paths which causes
   `trash-rs` to panic if encountered. I switched some of those code to use
   `OsString`s instead of `String`s. Unfortunately, I had to add a new
   dependency, `urlencoding`, in order to properly handle decoding non-UTF8
   byte slices.
   
   As of this commit, the test suite passes and code should be ready, but I
   will try to remove the `url` crate and use `urlencoding` in its place
   in the next commit.

### Other

 - <csr-id-58b99ef34a0dc6cce11fdc46c9fa18ffb013e33e/> Use objc2-foundation

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-0971b8f7f0f1e20ee4356a40ae6b2ba41900c4b3/> Support non-UTF8 paths.
   Note that this changes the type of returned paths to `OsString` from String,
   hence the breaking change.

## 4.0.0 (2024-03-12)

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-146ea03fe1c1c168b8a6fd135d9dc5c5c93f35d5/> Assure directory deletions on Windows don't put the entire contents into the trash.
   Instead, like on other platforms, on Windows it will now put the folder into the trash instead.
   
   Please note that this is not a breaking change in terms of API, but a *potentially* breaking change with older Windows versions. It's unknown if there are side-effects, as it's unknown why Windows had special behaviour previously.

## 3.0.5 (2023-07-06)

YANKED: It was discovered that symlinks aren't handled correctly, which can lead to removals of unrelated directory trees.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-c1feece952dcd70163ed06ac2af79fdbb3d692bc/> On **windows**, `delete()` will now delete recursively like on the other platforms.
   Note that the current implementation may consume a lot of memory as it will traverse the
   entire directory structure once while storing each path for later trashing.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-aa8cd7b05f8f0641d7fd73328619c2c45c7e050c/> disallow empty paths from being deleted.
   Previously passing "" for deletion wuold delete the current working directory
   as it would canonicalize any input path without validating the path is non-empty.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-67244ba2e4c71135b0ab36331dc465615e23211a/> Make chrono a default-enabled optional feature.
   This allows to turn chrono support off without actually affecting the
   ability to trash and restore items.
   `chrono` still has issues to dubious local-time support which relies
   on a c-library function that can cause undefined behaviour as it
   accesses an environment variable in a non-threadsafe fashion.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-367cf5f2616f1f49b115189b3bede3bb99f8324d/> avoid inconsistency when using relative paths in trashed file info.
   We use absolute paths now without trying to generate a relative path
   based on some top directory as the latter seems to be causing
   inconsistencies on some linux distros, as the restore path ends
   up being incorrect.
   
   Rather go with the absolute truth and don't fiddle with path
   transformations at all to make it work everywhere.

## 2.1.1 (2022-05-10)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-dcda6df8cefa06bf08e7eca7db2c34b050c2d913/> Properly reconstruct paths when restoring files on freedesktop if those were relative.
   
   Previously it would be unable to reconstruct original paths if the trash
   directory was on a mount point due to a 'split brain' of sorts.
   
   When trashing files it would create original path information based
   on them being relative to a mount point, but when restoring them
   it would reconstruct them to be relative to the trash top level
   directory.
   
   Now the reconstruction happens against to mount point itself which makes
   restoration match.

## 2.0.4 (2022-01-23)

We detected the possibility of UB in the Linux and FreeBSD versions of `get_mount_points()` and reduced the likelihood
of it happening in a multi-threaded environment by synchronizing access. You can read more about the state of
a more permanent fix [in the tracking issue](https://github.com/Byron/trash-rs/issues/42).

All previous 2.0.* releases which contained this function were yanked from crates-io.

### Fixes

* Make internal `get_mount_points()` thread-safe to reduce chance of UB greatly. 
  This may reduce performance of crates that are using trash from multiple threads somewhat, as a part of the operation
  is now synchronized.
* Fix build on FreeBSD, handle UB similarly to the above.
